For our project, we are going to create a Blackjack simulator. Blackjack is one of the most popular betting games at the casino. In the game, the players play against the dealer, trying to get cards that equal 21 without going over. It is a relatively simple game but one surprisingly replete with strategy. We will simplify the rules a little bit and add a cheating mode to the game, that will cause the dealer to cheat when possible. We hope to teach people the follies of gambling while also giving them a run for their money (haha). So who's ready to invest?

We're aren't the best artists, but here is a depiction of what the final product will look like. There will be a dealer and up to three players gathered around a table and dealt cards that will be handled for determining who wins and who loses.

- Button elements can have SVG or IMG children, which gives the button an interesting design
- tr and td elements are table row and column elements, which give more control when using tables
- hr and br are useful tools for adding horizontal line divisions and line breaks respectively
- Text spacing is based on width, not on line breaks in VS code
